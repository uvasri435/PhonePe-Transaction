# PhonePe-Transaction
PhonePe transaction insights provide users with a detailed overview and analysis of their payment history, helping them track spending, understand payment patterns, and manage their finances effectively.
This project is a comprehensive data analytics and visualization dashboard built using Streamlit to explore and understand PhonePe's digital payment ecosystem in India. 
Leveraging transaction and user data from 2018 to 2024, the dashboard connects to a MySQL database and dynamically visualizes key metrics using Plotly charts and GeoJSON-based maps. 
The Home page presents an all-time overview of transaction amounts across Indian states through an interactive map, along with insights into the top-performing states and districts. 
The Business Case Study section allows users to dive deeper into five focused analyses, including transaction dynamics, insurance penetration, user registration trends, and district-wise performance.
Users can interactively select the year and quarter to filter data, which is then displayed through intuitive bar and pie charts. 
The project uses Pandas for data manipulation, SQLAlchemy for database connectivity, and Plotly for high-quality interactive visualizations, offering a clear and insightful look into PhonePeâ€™s regional growth and usage trends.
